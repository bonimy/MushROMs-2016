## About
By this time, I finally decided to go completely into managed code and leave unmanaged dependencies out of the picture. This came with abandoning Lunar Compress. Because the author wasn't interested in releasing the source, this meant having to rewrite a lot of its code without a reference.

The two best features this code had were a really good LZ2 compression algorithm (better than Lunar Compress) and an SNES assembler (which was never finished).

Unfortunately, the design choices for the editors were too coupled and complicated. The project was abandoned in an attempt to better separate the functionality of these units.
